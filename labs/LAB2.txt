Question 4 
1. 
a. This interval should approximate the root fairly well, since the sign of the funciton changes in this interval. Depending on the tolerance of the function, the computer might find 1 exactly. 
Using the tolerance givin on the example code, you get that the root is at 0.99999... which is fairly close to our actual value. 

the approximate root is 0.9999999701976776
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = -2.98023206113385e-08


b. This interval will cause a failure of the function as the sign of the function does not change on this interval. 
Using the example code, we get that the error message reads 1. 

the approximate root is -1
the error message reads: 1
f(astar) = 2

c. This interval will have the exact same result as interval a, but will use one more iteration to get to the answer. 
Using the tolerance givin on the example code, you get that the root is at 0.99999... which is fairly far from our actual value. 

the approximate root is 0.9999999701976776
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = -2.98023206113385e-08



2. 
a. This function and interval gives us an out put of 0.9999... meaning that it found the root at 1. 

the approximate root is 0.999999976158142
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = -1.9073486775766932e-07

b. This function and interval give us an error output of 1 since the interval does not change signs on this interval. 

c. The code gives us back the eact foor of 0, since the interval falls right on the zero. 

With the second interval gives is an error output of 1 since the ends of the interval have the same sign when input into the function. 



3. 
a. The funtion gives back the output that we expect with 7^(1/5) being the fixed point. 

b. This function does not give back 7^(1/5) as the fixed point, it gives back an overflow error. This function had an issue with the x^5 part of the equation, which can grow very quickly into overflow. 

c. This function does not give back 7^(1/5) as the fixed point, it gives back an overflow error. It has the same issue as part b. 

c. This function does not give back 7^(1/5) as the fixed point, it gives back an overflow error. It has the same issue as part b.
