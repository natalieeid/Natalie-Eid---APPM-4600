import numpy as np 

h = 0.01 * (1/2**(np.arange(0, 10)))
s=np.pi/2

fds1 = (-np.sin(s+h)+np.sin(s))/h

fds2 = (-np.sin(s+h)+np.sin(s-h))/2*h

The forward difference method gives the following approximations for f'(pi/2)
[4.99995833e-03 2.49999479e-03 1.24999935e-03 6.24999919e-04
 3.12499990e-04 1.56249999e-04 7.81250002e-05 3.90625004e-05
 1.95312509e-05 9.76562546e-06]

The centered difference method gives the following approximations for f'(pi/2)
[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

So we will use the forward differences method.

Since we know that the distance between iterates should be decreasing at each iteration, we can use the distance between each iteration to determine when to recalculate the Jacobian. Look at the distance between iterates, if the distance between one iterate and the next iterate exceeds the previous iterate, recalculate the Jacobian. 

My version gave me the following result: 
[ 0.99843096 -0.10650059]
SlackerNewton: the error message reads: 1
SlackerNewton: took this many seconds: 0.0021979188919067382
SlackerNetwon: number of iterations is: 99
SlackerNetwon: number of Jacobian Inverses calculated is: 1

This method is very close to Lazy Newton, partners in my group had siginificantly better results, converging in 6 and 5 iterations. One method involved doing lazy newton for 3 iterations and recalculating on the 4th iteration if the method had not convered and the other method used regular newton's methon until we convergence reached a certain threshold and then reverted to lazy newton (this was the best tecnique).

Using the finite differences method we get the following result using h = 10**-3
[ 0.99860694 -0.10553049]
Newton: the error message reads: 0
Newton: took this many seconds: 0.0033918142318725584
Netwon: number of iterations is: 30

Using the finite differences method we get the following result using h = 10**-7
[ 0.99860694 -0.10553049]
Newton: the error message reads: 0
Newton: took this many seconds: 0.0036539649963378907
Netwon: number of iterations is: 30

So the answers are the same but the time to complete the iteration is different.
