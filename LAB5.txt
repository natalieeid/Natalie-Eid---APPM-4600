Lab 5

3.1 

1. The derivative of the function must be less than 1 at the initital point.

2. See lab5.bisection.to.boc.py for code. 

3. Yes, you must also imput the derivative. 

4. See code 

5. This method allows all intervals to converge to the root, even if the inital guess is not in the basin of convergence. This method still does not work for root with even multiplicity.
